# Home Assistant dashboards

<img style="float: right;" src="images/home_assistant_logo.png" alt="Home Assistant logo" >

I created so many different dashboards that I want to document and share them with you.
One by one I will add them here.

I created dashboards with all kind of elements in it:
* Weather:
  * [The Netherlands](homeassistant_dashboard_weather_nl) (Buienradar, weeralarm, pollen)
  * [External sites](homeassistant_dashboard_weather) (Thunderstorm) 
* [Formatting](homeassistant_dashboard_formatting) (Rounded temperature sensors)
* [Date & Time](homeassistant_dashboard_date_time) (Days countdown)
* [Different examples](homeassistant_dashboard_examples) (The latest news)
* [Chores](homeassistant_dashboard_chores)
* [Recipe manager](homeassistant_dashboard_mealie) (With meal weekplanner)
* HACS custom element:
  * [Auto entities](homeassistant_dashboard_card_auto-entities) 
  * [Mushroom](homeassistant_dashboard_card_mushroom) 
* [Control an Orcon ventilation system](../esphome/orcon_mechanic_ventilation)
* [Hardware monitor](homeassistant_hardware_monitor)

## Personal note


I started my home automation without Home Assistant. In those days I used an app ([Mqtt Dashboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.vetru.mqttdashboard)) where I could see and control all my devices. For my smart flows I used Node-RED.  
After I got more and more sensors I couldn't get a clear overview of the status of all my sensors anymore.
Then I found the solutions for this where people created floor plans of their house and add there sensor statuses and controls as layers on top of it. This was possible with the tool Home Assistant and so begon I with it. I created the floor plans I wanted, and I also really liked the (lovelace) dashboards with their endless possibilities.

I use Home Assistant pure as a presentation layer. That's why you don't find Home Assistant flows here but only Node-RED flows.
