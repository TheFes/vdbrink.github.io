# Packages mailbox - Allux 600

I was looking for a small-packages-mailbox where 80% of my ordered packages should fit in, so I don't have to wait, or stay at home, for the delivery guy to arrive, so I can receive my package.

## My requirements

In my search I was looking for a package mailbox with the next specs:
* All weatherproof;
* A shoebox-package-size should fit in it;
* It could contain multiple packages;
* Not possible to grab delivered packages out of it;
* A discrete design;
* Maximum price of &euro; 200,-

I found &euro; 200,- already a lot of money for such a box but in my search I found out this was only the bottom of the market prices. Those boxes, for what I was looking for, reach to prices like &euro; 500,-!

I found the Allux 600 box, which match almost all my criteria, but only costs &euro; 250,-.\
It's made of coated steel, it has 12 year guarantee against rust, a shoebox can indeed fit in it. You can drop multiple package in it, but you can't grab one out of it. The design is a tight black box which doesn't atrack too much attention. 

Because the price was a bit too high, and I didn't need it direct, I decided to put it on my wishlist and created a rule in my Node-RED daily-check-for-good-offers list, next to the laundry detergents and wait if it will be cheaper on a later moment.\
I forgot about it until on Black Friday I received a notification it was now on sale for &euro; 189,-, so now it match all my criteria and I ordered it! Also in the meanwhile I didn't found any other one with better specs.

Open the lid and you can put your package inside the mailbox.\
It has some bump cushions, so it doesn't close with a lot of noise.

In front there is a locked door where you can reach the packages.

## Mounting

By default you buy the box without any mounting materials.
The default the only provided solution to anker the box on the ground is a ~&euro; 90,- steel frame. In my opinion way too expensive and it should also be possible to solve this for way less but that needs a creative solution.

<img src="images_allux-600\allux_default_mount.webp" height="250px" alt="default mount"/>

The Allux has already in the bottom in each corner, and in the center, pre-drilled-holes.


<img src="images_allux-600\allux-600_bottom.jpg" height="250px" alt="default holes"/>

My shopping list for my DIY anker mount: 

* A heavy flower box in the sale from the local garden shop [&euro; 7,-]
  * This had already a hole in the middle to stick the pipe through and mount it to the pipe.

* [1x Stainless Steel Threaded End Pipes 12mm x 100 cm](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/gamma-draadeind-rvs-m12-x-1000-mm/p/B451457) [&euro; 13,79 at Gamma]

  <img src="images_allux-600\rvs_m12_1000_threaded_end.jpg" height="150px" alt="1x Stainless Steel Threaded End Pipes 12mm x 100 cm"/>

* [a box with 4x galvanised metal plate 40x40mm](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/gamma-zeskantmoer-m12-verzinkt-4-stuks/p/B458313) [&euro; 5,59 at Gamma]

  <img src="images_allux-600\ring.jpg" height="150px" alt="4x galvanised metal plate 40x40mm"/>

* [a box with 4x galvanised 12mm bolts](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/gamma-zeskantmoer-m12-verzinkt-4-stuks/p/B458313) [&euro; 2,59 at Gamma]

  <img src="images_allux-600\bolt.jpg" height="150px" alt="4x galvanised 12mm bolt"/>

Which make the total costs for my DIY anker mount &euro; 28,97. This saves me ~&euro; 60,-

I screw a bolt and plate on each side of the hole in the flower box so the pipe is strong attached to the flower box. The pipe must stick only 15 cm above streetlevel and the rest will be in the ground underneath the flower box.

<img src="images_allux-600\pin_bolt.jpg" height="250px" alt="screw the plates"/>

I grave a hole which match the size of the flower box, put it in it and fill it again with sand and stones for extra weight. 

<img src="images_allux-600\flowerbox_in_the_ground_with_pin.jpg" height="250px" alt="mount in the ground"/>

Now you only see the pipe above the ground.\
Screw the bold on the pipe, almost to the ground and add a plate above it.

Now place the box over the pipe and see if the plate touch the bottom of the box when the box touch the ground.
Now add the plate inside the box over the pipe and screw the bold also from inside. Now the bolts and plates are strong together to each other on each side of the bottom. 

<img src="images_allux-600\pin_inside_allux.jpg" height="250px" alt="screw the bold also inside the allux"/>

Now the box isn't easy to move anymore!
And you don't see anything how it's mount to the ground.

## Stickers

Because the box has a discrete design it's maybe not direct clear for a delivery guy that this is meant for package.
So I designed two stickers:
* One on the lid of the box itself

  <img src="images_allux-600\sticker_package_box.jpg" height="250px" alt="packagebox lid sticker"/>

* And direct under the doorbell
