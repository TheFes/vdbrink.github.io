# ESPHome custom sensors and actuators

![ESPHome logo](images/esphome.png)

Not every sensor is available on the market as a complete product. 
Sometimes you need to create one yourself. 
This is really easy these days with ESPHome.

I wrote multiple articles about creating your own sensors and actuators based on the ESP (8266 or 32) chip with ESPHome:

* [Co2 sensor based on an SenseAir S8](co2_senseair_s8_sensor)
* [Control an Orcon mechanic ventilation system](orcon_mechanic_ventilation)
